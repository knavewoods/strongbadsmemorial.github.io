    <h2>Strong Bad = Very dead</h2>
    <p>yes... as it turns out our beloved masked luchador is dead.<br>
    he died when flash did (2020) along with all the other residents of free country USA.
    Now being a follower of strong bad emails i know that strong bad had very specific instructions 
    for when he died - i've decided to disregard absolutely all of them cause i know he can't do
    anything about it. Like yeah he could haunt me, but whats he gonna do as a weak ol ghost? open my 
    drawers when i've just closed them? Keep the tap running? make weird groaning noises in the night? 
      <em>oooooh</em>I'm just <em>so</em> scared - i'm just shaking in my litte booties over here.</p>
